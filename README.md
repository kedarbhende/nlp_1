# Reddit Social Network Analysis
A Python project to process, analyze and understand a Reddit dataset containing posts from COVID-related subreddits and a selection of random subreddits. This repo contains code for cleaning, exploratory data analysis, NLP on titles/selftexts, user/subreddit-level analysis and example modeling pipelines.
This project demonstrates end-to-end data work on Reddit posts:
Load and validate the CSV dataset (one row per post)
Clean and normalize post, user and subreddit fields
Exploratory analysis: post activity, user behavior, subreddit comparisons
NLP pipelines on title and selftext (preprocessing → features → simple models)
